      <h1>Unit Testing vs Design by Contract</h1>
    </header>

    <p>In the first half of <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> Andrew Hunt and David Thomas introduce concept of Design by Contract (DBC, for short).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In order to determine correctness of the program three questions must be answered:</p>

<ol>
<li>What does routine expect?</li>
<li>What does routine guarantee?</li>
<li>What does routine maintain?</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, Python can support this via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assert"><code>assert</code></a> statements and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)"><code>invariant</code></a> methods. But there is no native support in it as in Eiffel.</p>

<p>In second half of the book the concept of Unit Testing is explained. Writing tests can ensure to a first approximation previous three questions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine if just only one of this concepts is practiced. For example, a Design by Contract?</p>

<p>For now I want to emphasize just two points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bad customer experience. Assertions and invariants tends to be happen not in development environment but somewhere next in continuous delivery pipeline.</li>
<li>From technical perspective refactoring is hardly possible. Getting feedback about changes made to the system tends to be happen not in development environment also.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the contrary, I want to know about how changes affect system in the Work-In-Progress stage.</p>

<p>I think these both concepts - Unit Testing and DBC - should complement each other. Unit testing should be practiced and implemented in tests. DBC should be practiced and implemented as a mental model. Something that engineer should always have in the background during his work.</p>
