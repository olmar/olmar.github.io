    <p>Have you ever realized that the current state of architecture does not meet the current needs? One of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on had PostgreSQL and Neo4j databases with data tightly related between them.</p>

<p>There were several reasons of migrating data from graph to relational database.</p>

<p>From engineering side there was little variation in the relationships. Instead there were simple regular structures. Maximum what we had is a recursive structures which can be solved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/queries-with.html">Common Table Expressions</a> in PostgreSQL. Recursive lookup is not a problem for this case because depth of the path is small.</p>

<p>On the other hand having both relational and graph styles need mental context switching which increases a Cycle time.</p>

<p>Migration was not easy because it is a production system with real customers using it. Big challenge is absence of any tests and having limited amount of time.</p>

<p>Here are the list of techniques we used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making a plan in which order to migrate parts of the system</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">feature flag</a></li>
<li>Creating tests that compared data between results of some core functions with enabled feature flag vs disabled</li>
<li>Manual testing</li>
<li>Having one environment with enabled feature flag and another with disabled feature flag to compare behaviour of the system</li>
<li>Daily communication between engineers</li>
</ul>

<p>Having all that we were able to successfully migrate data. As a result development of new features became more easier. Initially performance was not a noticeable issue. After migration page response time even decreased. Instead of requesting data from two databases now it is just one.</p>

<p>What lesson should be drawn from this story? Choosing wrong technology can led to significant increase of Cycle time. That Neo4j database hadn&rsquo;t been solving any specific problem but added complexity. Having just PostgreSQL is enough for this system at the time.</p>

<p>Choose right tools for the right moment.</p>
